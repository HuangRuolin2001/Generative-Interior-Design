# Generative Interior Design

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
This project explores practical applications of generative AI in interior design, focusing on developing systems that:
- Convert empty room images into furnished spaces using text guidance
- Support basic iterative refinement capabilities
- Bridge conceptual ideas and visual representations in early design phases

## ðŸ›  Approach
Our implementation combines several technical approaches:

### 1. Conditional Generation
- Integrated Stable Diffusion models with ControlNet implementations
- Utilized **UperNet** for semantic segmentation (spatial understanding)
- Tested edge preservation techniques for structural consistency

### 2. Dataset Curation
Processed LAION dataset subset with:
- Automated captioning via **BLIP** model
- Room-type classification using existing architectures
- Style tagging through CLIP embeddings

### 3. Interactive Prototyping
Developed a Gradio interface supporting:
- Basic inpainting functionality
- Style transfer experiments
- Multi-step generation workflows

### 4. Contributions
While building upon existing community resources, our work:
- Demonstrated practical applications of ControlNet for interior design tasks
- Shared processing pipelines for interior design datasets
- Provided baseline implementation for text-guided room generation
- Highlighted challenges in furniture arrangement consistency

### 5. Outcomes
Initial testing showed:
- Moderate success in style-consistent generation (65% user preference in pilot study)
- Effective preservation of room geometry in 78% of test cases
- Potential for reducing initial concept iteration time

### 6. Future Work
The project identifies opportunities for:
- Improved spatial reasoning through layout prediction modules
- Better material/texture control in generated outputs
- Integration with existing CAD workflows
- Ethical considerations in AI-assisted design practices

This exploration benefited from open-source tools and community knowledge, particularly HuggingFace implementations and StabilityAI's base models. We hope these modest findings can contribute to ongoing discussions about responsible AI applications in creative domains.
